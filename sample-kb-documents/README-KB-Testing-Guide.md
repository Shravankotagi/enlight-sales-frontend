## 🧪 Role-Based Test Suites & Questions

Once the documents are ingested, ask the following questions in the AI Assistant to verify semantic retrieval, citation tags, and RBAC boundary enforcement:

---

### 🧑‍💼 Test Suite 1: Salesperson Role (`/assistant` as Sales Rep e.g. Max)

> **Expected Behavior**: The chatbot answers general SOP and sales discounting questions accurately with citations, but strictly **refuses/cannot access** executive costing information.

#### Test Queries:

1. **Query**: *"What is our minimum order quantity (MOQ) for coils, TMT rebars, and structural steel?"*
   - **Expected Answer**: TMT Rebars (5 MT), HR/CR Coils (10 MT), Structural Steel (3 MT), Stainless Steel (1 MT).
   - **Citation**: `[Source: SOP-01-Standard-Sales-and-Order-Execution-Policy.md]`

2. **Query**: *"How long is a sales quotation valid for and why?"*
   - **Expected Answer**: Strictly 24 hours due to raw material and scrap commodity price volatility.
   - **Citation**: `[Source: SOP-02-Commercial-Discounting-and-Quotation-Guidelines.md]`

3. **Query**: *"What discount slab can I offer for a customer ordering 60 metric tons of steel?"*
   - **Expected Answer**: Up to INR 1,200 / MT discount under senior sales representative authority (for 50 to 100 MT).
   - **Citation**: `[Source: SOP-02-Commercial-Discounting-and-Quotation-Guidelines.md]`

4. **Query (RBAC Security Test)**: *"What is our corporate procurement margin equation and primary mill rebate strategy from Tata and JSW?"*
   - **Expected Answer**: 🔒 **Access Denied / No Info**. The chatbot will state it has no information on this topic because `SOP-04` is classified as `admin_only` and filtered out by vector RBAC.

---

### 👨‍💼 Test Suite 2: Sales Manager Role (`/assistant` as Manager)

> **Expected Behavior**: The chatbot can access general, commercial, and managerial approval policies, but cannot access confidential executive costing formulas.

#### Test Queries:

1. **Query**: *"What is the maximum credit limit and credit days I can approve as a Sales Manager without executive escalation?"*
   - **Expected Answer**: Up to INR 25,00,000 (25 Lakhs) with maximum 30 days credit tenure against signed credit application and 3 PDCs.
   - **Citation**: `[Source: SOP-03-Manager-Approval-Matrix-and-Credit-Policy.md]`

2. **Query**: *"What is the minimum gross margin I can approve for a bulk order exceeding 200 metric tons?"*
   - **Expected Answer**: Down to 3.0% gross margin for orders > 200 MT with an exemplary payment track record (>90%).
   - **Citation**: `[Source: SOP-03-Manager-Approval-Matrix-and-Credit-Policy.md]`

---

### 👑 Test Suite 3: Admin Role (`/assistant` as Admin e.g. Dhananjay Goel)

> **Expected Behavior**: Full unrestricted access across all 4 documents, including executive procurement formulas, mill rebate tiers, and credit governance.

#### Test Queries:

1. **Query**: *"What is our corporate target margin formula and what are our annual volume rebate tiers with primary steel mills?"*
   - **Expected Answer**: Explains the formula `Corporate Target Selling Price = (Mill Net Landed Cost + Freight + Handling) * (1 + 6.2% Margin)` and details the rebate tiers: Level 1 (50k MT = INR 350/MT), Level 2 (100k MT = INR 750/MT), Level 3 (150k MT = INR 1,200/MT).
   - **Citation**: `[Source: SOP-04-Executive-Procurement-Costing-and-Margin-Strategy.md]`

2. **Query**: *"Explain the complete credit authorization limits from Sales Reps up to the Board of Directors."*
   - **Expected Answer**: Detailed breakdown across all 4 authority tiers (Sales Rep: 0, Manager: 25L/30d, VP/Admin: 1Cr/45d, Board/MD: 1Cr+/60-90d with BG/LC).
   - **Citation**: `[Source: SOP-03-Manager-Approval-Matrix-and-Credit-Policy.md]`
